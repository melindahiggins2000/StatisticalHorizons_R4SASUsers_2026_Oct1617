* make a copy to WORK library;

data helpmkh;
  set r4sasusers.helpmkh;
  run;

* check data read in ok;
proc contents data=helpmkh; run;

* run proc univariate to get descriptive stats
  and check the normality assumptions of the
  following numeric/continuous vars
  - add other variables for rest of homework;

proc univariate data=helpmkh plots;
  var age pss_fr pcs mcs cesd a15a a15b d1 e2b i1 i2;
  run;

* you can also use proc means
  here is an example for descriptive stats
  for age pss_fr pcs mcs cesd;

proc means data=helpmkh n min max mean std;
  var age pss_fr pcs mcs cesd;
  run;

* and for
  non-parametric stats next
  a15a a15b d1 e2b i1 i2;

proc means data=helpmkh n min max median q1 q3;
  var a15a a15b d1 e2b i1 i2;
  run;

* get frequencies for categorical variables
  female racegrp homeless g1b;

proc freq data=helpmkh;
  tables female racegrp homeless g1b;
  run;
